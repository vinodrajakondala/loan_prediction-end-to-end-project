Intro:
-------------

 Financial industry is highly regulated, thus any model classify the customers basis on their behavior, demographics etc.
 is highly regulated and must be explained to authorities to ensure unbiased operations.

 Lending money/loan is riskly if we scantion to defaulters. So we must reduce bad loans for profitablity of financial industry.
 The bank wants to improve their services by finding interesting groups of clients (e.g. to differentiate between good and bad clients)

 The bank managers have only vague idea, who is good client (whom to offer some additional services) 
 and who is bad client (whom to watch carefully to minimize the bank looses)

 The ML model should be explainable and be able to balance between risk and profits.


STEPS:
----------
conda create -n Loan_Prediction python=3.7
conda activate Loan_Prediction
pip install jupyter


Random Forest predicts better than Logistic Regression, however, in the banking industry, as per the government regulations 
and compliance requirements, one should be able to interpret the model results and clearly explain the reason for declining the loans to the clients.
Hence Logistic Regression should be used to build the real model for deploying the same in production. 
Logistic Regression is simple which is a score that is a combination of coefficients multiplied by features. 
It can be interpreted as probabilities. If users are declined the features where their scores were low can 
be identified and the account holder can be told how to improve their score.
